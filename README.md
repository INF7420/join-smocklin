# INF 7420_Project

I am going to build a portfolio site, so that I may showcase my work from the MLIS program to help me find a job once I graduate. 

## Wireframes

I like to be organized and to plan projects before I complete them, so here are some wireframes to show the possible layout and architecture of my site.
