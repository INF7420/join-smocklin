          <div class="about-bio">
            <p class="bio-desk">My name is Sarah Mocklin, and I spent the majority of my life living in the South and Mid-South, but relocated to Michigan a could of years ago. I began the MLIS program in the Fall of 2018, and expect to
              graduate at the end of the Winter 2020 semester. However, my history with the library goes back all the way to the day I was born. My mother was an MLIS student at Louisiana State University in the early 90s.
              On the day I was born, she was student teaching at an elementary school library and went into labor. Several hours later, I was born! And as the story goes, almost born in a library. Throughout my childhood and
              young adult years my mother was an elementary and middle school librarian...and sometimes even my librarian. This imparted in me not only a love of books and wanting to share this love, but also a desire to provide 
              books to those who cannot afford to always go to a book store and buy them new. Many of my mother's students grew up in poverty where the school library was their only regular access to books. Following high school,
              I attended the University of Memphis and received a Bachelor of Arts degree with concentrations in English Literature and History. Now, I am hoping to finish my degree and find a position in a children's section of a library 
              or in doing reference work.
